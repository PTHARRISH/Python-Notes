# Introduction to OOPS concept:
# Python supports both procedure-oriented and object-oriented features.
# Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm that uses classes and objects to look similar to real life. 
# OOPs has four central concepts: Encapsulation,Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.
# OOPs mainly works upon two keys is Attributes and Functionality.

# CLASS :
# A class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. 
# Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together. 
# Creating a new class creates a new type of object, allowing new instances of that type to be made. 
# Each class instance can have attributes attached to it for maintaining its state. 
# Class instances can also have methods (defined by their class) for modifying their state.

# The class creates a user-defined data structure, which holds its own data members and member functions, 
# which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class. 
# A class is like a blueprint for an object.

# Some points on Python class:
# Classes are created by keyword class.
# Attributes are the variables that belong to a class.
# Attributes are always public and can be accessed using the dot (.) operator.
# Classes consist of Data and Functions. 
# The Data in class is known as Members and functions of the class are known as methods.
