# Python __init__ Method 
# The __init__ method is similar to constructors in C++ and Java. 
# It is run as soon as an object of a class is instantiated. 
# The method is useful to do any initialization you want to do with your object. 
# Now let us define a class and create some objects using the self and __init__ method.

# What is __init__ in Python?
# The Default __init__ Constructor in C++ and Java. 
# Constructors are used to initializing the objectâ€™s state. 
# The task of constructors is to initialize(assign values) to the data members of the 
# class when an object of the class is created. 
# Like methods, a constructor also contains a collection of statements (i.e. instructions) that are executed 
# at the time of Object creation. 
# It is run as soon as an object of a class is instantiated. 
# The method is useful to do any initialization you want to do with your object.
