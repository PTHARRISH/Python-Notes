# Python Private Method.
# In Python, we can define the private method by prefixing the single underscore to the method name,
# and like the other programming languages.
# we cannot prevent accessing the private method outside the class in python. 
# Simply we can say the private method is used only internally for the defined class.


# What is private method and public method?
# A private method is the method that should be called only inside the defined class,
# whereas the Public method is defined within the class, can be called on an instance of the defined class.

# Now letâ€™s define the private method and see how the private method is differed from the public method.


# Example
# In this example we are going to create a base class by defining the public method and private methods 
# inside the class and after that we will check whether the private method can be accessible by the other class 
# or outside the class.
