# Python - Encapsulation
# Encapsulation is one of the key concepts of object-oriented languages like Python, Java, etc. 
# Encapsulation is used to restrict access to methods and variables. 
# In encapsulation, code and data are wrapped together within a single unit from being modified by accident.
# Encapsulation is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and code acting on the data (methods) together as a single unit.
# In encapsulation, the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes, 
# and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class.


# Real-World Example:
# Lets Take a look at a real-world example of encapsulation. 
# There are many sections in a company, such as the accounts and finance sections. 
# The finance section manages all financial transactions and keeps track of all data. 
# The sales section also handles all sales-related activities. 
# They keep records of all sales. 
# Sometimes, a finance official may need all sales data for a specific month. 
# In this instance, he is not permitted to access the data from the sales section. 
# First, he will need to contact another officer from the sales section to request the data. This is encapsulation. 
# The data for the sales section, as well as the employees who can manipulate it, 
# are all wrapped together under the single name "sales section". 
# Encapsulation is another way to hide data. 
# This example shows that the data for sections such as sales, finance, and accounts are hidden from all other sections.
