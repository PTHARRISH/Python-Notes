# Example of OOPs using Cars:-
# Suppose you have details of many cars. 
# All cars have the same properties like a year of manufacture, Model, Top speed, Color, etc.,
# and the same functions like start, speed up, speed down, stop, etc. 
# so we can say that all types of cars have the same information so we can create a common structure for store the information. 
# This structure is called class and can have different objects. 
# Each object shows a different type of car with different information.

# Here we will make Car class, and it will work as a basic template for other objects. 
# We will make car class objects (Ferrari, BMW, and Mercedes). 
# Each Car Object will have its own, Year of Manufacture, model, Top Speed, color, Engine Power, efficiency, etc.

# The car class would allow the programmer to store similar information unique to each car 
# (different models, colors, top speeds, etc.) and associate the appropriate information.
