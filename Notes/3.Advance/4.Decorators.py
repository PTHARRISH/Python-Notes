# Decorators in Python
# Decorators are a very powerful and useful tool in Python 
# since it allows programmers to modify the behaviour of a function or class. 
# Decorators allow us to wrap another function in order to extend the behaviour of the wrapped function, 
# without permanently modifying it.
