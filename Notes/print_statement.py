# Python print() Function

# The print() function prints the specified message to the screen or other standard output device.
# The message can be a string or any other object. 
# The object will be converted into a string before written to the screen.
# The simplest way to produce output is using the print() function where you can pass zero or more expressions separated by commas.
# This function converts the expressions you pass into a string before writing to the screen.

# Syntax:
# print(object(s), sep=separator, end=end, file=file, flush=flush)

# Example:
# Printing a message on the screen:
print("Hello  World")
# Output:  Hello World


# Printing more than one object:
print("Hello", "how are you?")
# Output: Hello how are you?
