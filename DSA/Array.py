# Array:
# An array is a type of linear data structure 
# that is defined as a collection of elements with same or different data types. 
# They exist in both single dimension and multiple dimensions. 
# These data structures come into picture when there is a necessity 
# to store multiple elements of similar nature together(data type) at one place.

# The difference between an array index and a memory address 
# array index acts like a key value to label the elements in the array. 
# a memory address is the starting address of free memory available.

# Following are the important terms to understand the concept of Array.

# Element − Each item stored in an array is called an element.
# Index − Each location of an element in an array has a numerical index, which is used to identify the element.
