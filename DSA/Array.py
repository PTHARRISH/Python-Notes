# Array:
# An array is a type of linear data structure 
# that is defined as a collection of elements with same or different data types. 
# They exist in both single dimension and multiple dimensions. 
# These data structures come into picture when there is a necessity 
# to store multiple elements of similar nature together(data type) at one place.

# The difference between an array index and a memory address 
# array index acts like a key value to label the elements in the array. 
# a memory address is the starting address of free memory available.

# Following are the important terms to understand the concept of Array.

# Element − Each item stored in an array is called an element.
# Index − Each location of an element in an array has a numerical index, which is used to identify the element.

# An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations.
# The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together. 
# This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value, 
# i.e., the memory location of the first element of the array (generally denoted by the name of the array).

# Creating an Array
# Array in Python can be created by importing an array module. 
# array(data_type, value_list) is used to create an array with data type and value list specified in its arguments. 

# There are thre ways to import array module:
# Using import (import array)
# Using import and call alias name (import array as arr)
# from modules import all methods ( from array import * )

# Some of the data types are mentioned below which will help in creating an array of different data types. 
# i - signed Int - allow positive and negative values
# I - unsigned Int - allow only positive values
# d - double - allow double values
# f - float - allow floating point values
# u - unicode character - allow unicode character values
# b - signed byte integer - allow positive and negative byte integer values
# B - unsigned byte integer - allow positive byte integer values only
